An open-source PHP web framework to allow for quick and easy development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) design pattern.
It provides an installer that helps make setup easy and a deployer that helps with deployment, saving
you the hassle of going to your code to change your deployment settings every time

## How to Install
* Clone Repository 
* Open in localhost and follow installation process. After installation, a database will be created with the database name and paramaters set during installation process
